      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Turtles, beloved creatures of the sea, are facing a myriad of threats that cast a dark shadow over their survival. One of the most pressing concerns is the loss and degradation of their habitats. As urbanization and coastal development continue to encroach upon their nesting beaches, turtles are left with diminishing options for safe and suitable nesting grounds. This disruption in their natural nesting process significantly impacts their ability to reproduce and perpetuate their species.<br>
        Turtles face threats such as habitat loss, pollution, climate change, illegal trade, and accidental capture in fishing gear. These risks disrupt nesting sites, harm their health, affect breeding patterns, and contribute to declining populations. Conservation efforts are vital to protect turtles and their ecosystems. We will go through each of the main threats and cover as to how we can prevent/minimize them. </p>
