                    <p class="paragraph">Turtles are fascinating creatures that have captured the hearts and imaginations of people all over the world. Sri Lanka is home to a diverse range of turtle species, each with its own unique characteristics and traits. Among the most common species found in Sri Lanka are the Green Turtle, Olive Ridley Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and the Flatback Turtle. Each of these species has its own distinct features and habitat preferences, making them a fascinating subject for researchers and nature enthusiasts alike.<br>
                        Let's dive into some more detailed information about the different species of turtles found in Sri Lanka that we discussed earlier.

                    <p class="description">The Green Turtle, this species is scientifically known as Chelonia mydas and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length and weigh up to 315 kilograms. They are herbivorous and feed primarily on sea grasses and algae. Green turtles are known to nest in Sri Lanka between the months of November and April, and can lay up to 200 eggs at a time.</p><br>

                    <p>Anatomically, a few characteristics distinguish the green turtle from the other members of its family. Unlike its close relative the hawksbill turtle, the green turtle's snout is very short and its beak is unhooked. The neck cannot be pulled into the shell.[28] The sheath of the turtle's upper jaw possesses a denticulated edge, while its lower jaw has stronger, serrated, more defined denticulation. The dorsal surface of the turtle's head has a single pair of prefrontal scales. Its carapace is composed of five central scutes flanked by four pairs of lateral scutes.<br>

                    <p class="description2">TThe Hawksbill sea turtle is a critically endangered sea turtle belonging to the family Cheloniidae and adult hawksbill sea turtles typically grow to 1 m (3 ft) in length, weighing around 80 kg (180 lb) on average. The hawksbill is biofluorescent and is the first reptile recorded with this characteristic. It is unknown if the effect is due to the turtle's diet. Adult hawksbill sea turtles are primarily found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges in and around these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit a wide range of habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Hawksbills mate biannually in secluded lagoons off their nesting beaches in remote islands throughout their range. The most significant nesting beaches are in Mexico, the Seychelles, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The mating season for Atlantic hawksbills usually spans April to November.</p><br>

                    <p>Several characteristics of the hawksbill sea turtle distinguish it from other sea turtle species. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on each flipper.<br>

During the nesting season in Sri Lanka, which is from October to April, guests are able to spot at least a dozen of sea turtles in just one day.</p><br>

                    <p>Leatherback turtles have the most hydrodynamic body of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body. A large pair of front flippers powers the turtles through the water. Like other sea turtles, the leatherback has flattened forelimbs adapted for swimming in the open ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of flippers.Leatherbacks have been viewed as unique among extant non-avian reptiles for their ability to maintain high body temperatures using metabolically generated heat, or endothermy. Initial studies on their metabolic rates found leatherbacks had resting metabolisms around three times higher than expected for reptiles of their size.Their favored breeding beaches are mainland sites facing the deep water, and they seem to avoid those sites protected by coral reefs.<br>

              <p class="description4">The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The average loggerhead measures around 90 cm (35 in) in carapace length when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135 kg (298 lb), with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg (1,000 lb).The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. In Sri Lanka the best time to see them nest is between January and March</p><br>

              <p>The loggerhead sea turtle is the world's largest hard-shelled turtle, slightly larger at average and maximum mature weights than the green sea turtle and the Galapagos tortoise. The head and carapace (upper shell) range from a yellow-orange to a reddish brown, while the plastron (underside) is typically pale yellow. The turtle's neck and sides are brown on the tops and yellow on the sides and bottom. Loggerhead sea turtles observed in captivity and in the wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as gastropods, bivalves, decapods, and horseshoe crabs. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. <br>

            <p class="description5">The olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), also known commonly as the Pacific ridley sea turtle, is a species of turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is the second-smallest and most abundant of all sea turtles found in the world, growing to about 61 cm (2 ft) in carapace length (measured along the curve) and the olive ridley sea turtle rarely weighs over 50 kg (110 lb). Males and females grow to the same size, but females have a slightly more rounded carapace as compared to males. The olive ridley turtle has a circumtropical distribution, living in tropical and warm waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans from India, Arabia, Japan, and Micronesia south to southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. the Olive Ridley which appear in large numbers during their nesting seasons between September and November and November and January respectively.</p><br>

            <p>The olive ridley is predominantly carnivorous, especially in immature stages of its lifecycle.[21] Animal prey consists of protochordates or invertebrates, which can be caught in shallow marine waters or estuarine habitats. Common prey items include jellyfish, tunicates, salps,[22] sea urchins, bryozoans, bivalves, snails, shrimp, crabs, rock lobsters, and sipunculid worms. The carapace of the olive ridley is flattened dorsally and highest anterior to the bridge. it has a medium-sized, broad head that appears triangular from above. The head's concave sides are most obvious on the upper part of the short snout. It has paddle-like fore limbs, each having two anterior claws. The upper parts are grayish-green to olive in color, but sometimes appear reddish due to algae growing on the carapace. The bridge and hingeless plastron of an adult vary from greenish white in younger individuals to a creamy yellow in older specimens (maximum age is up to 50 years).<br>
